# JParserUtil
A set of utilities to extract info from Java source file using JDK tools

about how to extract info from Java source file, you can use ``tools.jar`` from JDK, where live in (Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk_version/Contents/Home/lib) for OSX

and you can read the post in my blog(in Chinese): [http://ragnraok.github.io/using-jdk-parser.html](http://ragnraok.github.io/using-jdk-parser.html) 

The purpose of this project is provide a fundamental tools to build an [Annotation Processor Tool](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/apt/) without launching the compile process , just simply parse the source file, and do what we can do in APT, which makes our Java development more comfortable.
